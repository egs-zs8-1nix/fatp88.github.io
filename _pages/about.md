# **About me.**

I am an Electronics and Telecommunications engineer with a broad list of interests. I'm passionate about the electronics world, satellite communications, networking and cloud computing.

I have had my fair share of experience with cyber security with the management of both Linux and Windows servers, use of active directory and finding vulnerabilities in a system.

My current specialization is Data Science, starting with Data Analytics. I'll blog my progress here, while describing my steps from the start,  including the future projects I'll work on. Last but not least, I'll start learning more about machine learning as well.
